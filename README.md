# Bookarklets
I list of my favorite bookmarklets. Can be used in school or just for fun.
If you don't understand one of the bookmarklets, make an issue and ask me how to use the bookmarklet that you're having trouble with. I will add all explanations in the wiki. Visit https://github.com/YourMajestyTheEye/Google-Snake for more bookmarklets that modify Google Snake or visit https://github.com/YourMajestyTheEye/Scratch-Addons for some bookmarklets that modify Scratch
